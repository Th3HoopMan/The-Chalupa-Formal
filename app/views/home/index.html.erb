            <p class="text-xs-center"> Said to rival the Catalina Wine Mixer and the Grammyâ€™s
              in terms of luxury, The Chalupa Formal takes a group of guests on the adventure of a lifetime.
              An event where the most obscure salad forks are used, where the craziest tales fall from the lips
              of distinguished guests, and where every goblet runneth over with pure happiness. For
              longest time this event was only a story parents told their children to behave, but no longer.
              With a decent helping of ambition and planning the countdown has now begun. Which  mortals
              will be invited to have their lives elevated to a status once thought unobtainable?

         <p class="question"><strong>Q: Why are you guys doing this?</strong></p>
         <p class="answer">A: I (Joseph) as a non-Greek college student was always intruguied about the next
         level prom events that are Greek formals. Instead of just trying to attend one like a normal
       person, I wondered if it was possible to make my own without any knowledge of what actually
       goes on at formals. After awhile, what started out as a joke has now turned into The
         Chalupa Formal. I began this as an opportunity for any student, Greek or Independent, to
         get a chance to take part in an overly extravagant night for no other reason than to
         get away from school for a moment and have a surreal college experience.

        <p class="question"><strong>Q: So this is seriously happening?</strong></p>
        <p class="answer">A: Yup.</p>
       </div>

         <div class="faq">
         <p class="question"><strong>Q: How do I get an invite?</strong></p>
         <p class="answer">A: We will have a two round guest selection process. An application will
         go live late August that everyone who is interested in attending must fill out. After carefully reviewing
        each application, we will set up interviews with the second rounders. We will then
        select a handful of people to join us at the Chalupa Formal.</p>
        </div>


        <div class="faq">
        <p class="question"><strong>Q: Really? Interviews? Isn't that a bit much?</strong></p>
        <p class="answer">A: Although we wish we could invite everyone interested, that's just not feasible
         for our first go around. Furthermore, we want to ensure that all of our guests are really interested
       and committed to being a part of this experience with us. We feel that this selection process is our
        best option to build a strong guest list.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq">
        <p class="question"><strong>Q: Are dates allowed?</strong></p>
        <p class="answer">A: We have made the difficult decision to not allow dates at The Chalupa Formal.
        In order to invite as many people as possible without dealing with an overwhelming
        number of people, only invited guests will be allowed to attend. Although there may be room
        to invite dates to the after party.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq">
        <p class="question"><strong>Q: Are there fees associated with these events?</strong></p>
        <p class="answer">A: Yes. Because we aren't funded by anyone but ourselves, we will require each guest
        to pay a not yet determined fee to participate. We will only ask for enough to cover
        the activities and gifts associated with the event and no more. We are hoping to keep costs
        as low as possible ($50 or less). </p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq">
        <p class="question"><strong>Q: What can or can't I do at the Chalupa Formal?</strong></p>
        <p class="answer">A: We will discuss this in great detail with all guests who accept their invite. We want
          all of our guests to feel comfortable and safe during our events.</p>
