            <p class="text-xs-center"> Said to rival the Catalina Wine Mixer and the Grammyâ€™s
              in terms of luxury, The Chalupa Formal takes a group of guests on the adventure of a lifetime.
              An event where the most obscure salad forks are used, where the craziest tales fall from the lips
              of distinguished guests, and where every goblet runneth over with pure happiness. For the
              longest time this event was only a story parents told their children to behave, but no longer.
              With a decent helping of ambition and planning the countdown has now begun. Which  mortals
              will be invited to have their lives elevated to a status once thought unobtainable?

           <p class="question"><strong>Q: So...wait...what is The Chalupa Formal? (Summary)</strong></p>
           <p class="answer">A: The Chalupa (semi) Formal is a one night event where a group of students
             can experience an extravagant and fun night in Atlanta without putting in much work on their part.
             We plan the event, you show up and have fun. There will be small internal mixers (movie nights, belt line, potluck, etc.) leading up to
             the semi formal to help everyone  get to know each other. The outline of events for the actual semi formal
              is listed above in the semi formal section (go figure).  Hopefully by the end of the semester
             we've created awesome  new memories and relationships between and exceptional group of people.
             Details on next semester's formal will be coming later.

          <p class="question"><strong>Q:What ISN'T The Chalupa Formal?</strong></p>
          <p class="answer">A: A date night. A dance. A sporting event. A class. A Greek
            event. A cult. A reunion. A typical outing. An all out brawl. What you'd expect.

         <div class="faq">
         <p class="question"><strong>Q: Why are you guys doing this?</strong></p>
         <p class="answer">A: I (Joseph) as a non-Greek college student was always intruguied about the next
         level prom events that are Greek formals. Instead of just trying to attend one like a normal
       person, I wondered if it was possible to make my own without any knowledge of what actually
       goes on at formals. After awhile, what started out as a joke has now turned into The
         Chalupa Formal. I began this as an opportunity for any student, Greek or Independent, to
         get a chance to take part in an overly extravagant night for no other reason than to
         get away from school for a moment and have a surreal college experience.

        <p class="question"><strong>Q: So this is seriously happening?</strong></p>
        <p class="answer">A: Yup.</p>
       </div>

         <div class="faq">
         <p class="question"><strong>Q: How do I get an invite?</strong></p>
         <p class="answer">A: Everyone interested in attending must fill out the application that is linked above(App closes Sep. 9).
           After carefully reviewing each application, depending on the amount of applications received,
           we may set up group interviews with the second rounders on Sep. 11.
           We will then select a handful of people to join us at the Chalupa Formal.</p>
        </div>


        <div class="faq">
        <p class="question"><strong>Q: Really? Interviews? Isn't that a bit much?</strong></p>
        <p class="answer">A: Yeah I know. Although we wish we could invite everyone interested, that's just not feasible
         for our first go around. Furthermore, we want to ensure that all of our guests are really interested
       and committed to being a part of this experience with us. We feel that this selection process is our
        best option to build a strong guest list. We will notify applicants if interviews are necessary after applications close.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq">
        <p class="question"><strong>Q: Sounds like a lot of work.</strong></p>
        <p class="answer">A: First of all, that's not a question. Second of all, the application and (possible) interview
        is the only hurdle you'll have to get past. We just want to make sure you're committed to particpating and are also
        not a murderer. Once you're in, you're in, and the real fun begins. The point of this event is to cut
        out the pledge process, the consistent dues, the commitment, the stress, and just jump into the good stuff.</p>
        </div>


        <div class="faq">
        <p class="question"><strong>Q: What kind of applicants are you looking for?</strong></p>
        <p class="answer">A: We are looking for GT students that are looking to meet to new friends
          and experience a fancy event. We want students that bring something unique to the table. Funny,
          inquisitive, playful, bold, creative, and other neato personalities are all welcome.
        </p>

        <div class="faq">
        <p class="question"><strong>Q: Are dates allowed?</strong></p>
        <p class="answer">A: We have made the difficult decision to not allow dates at The Chalupa Formal.
        In order to invite as many people as possible without dealing with an overwhelming
        number of people, only invited guests will be allowed to attend. We also want to stress that this
        is not a typical formal. Our end goal for this event is to have everyone  make leave with 15ish new friends
        they wouldn't otherwise have made. </p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq">
        <p class="question"><strong>Q: Will there be alcohol?</strong></p>
        <p class="answer">A: No. We will have underage students attending the event and therefore
        cannot distribute alcohol to guests, because that would be a lil but illegal.
        If you'd like to order your own drink while at the restaurant then you can go for it.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq">
        <p class="question"><strong>Q: Are there fees associated with these events?</strong></p>
        <p class="answer">A: Yes. Because we aren't funded by anyone but ourselves, we will require each guest
        to pay a not yet determined fee to participate. We will only ask for enough to cover
        the activities and gifts associated with the event and no more. We are hoping to keep costs
        as low as possible ($50 or less). </p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq">
        <p class="question"><strong>Q: What can or can't I do at the Chalupa Formal?</strong></p>
        <p class="answer">A: We will discuss this in great detail with all guests who accept their invite. We want
          all of our guests to feel comfortable and safe during our events.</p>
